    "systemMessage": "You are contributing to SafeWebTool, a privacy-focused website offering simple, serverless browser tools. All tools must run fully client-side in the user's browser with no server interaction or data upload. Each tool should live in its own folder under /tool/ using clean, non-hyphenated paths (e.g., /text/yaml) and follow a modular Vite structure. JavaScript filenames must match the tool path (e.g., yaml.js for /text/yaml) to keep code organized. Expect 100+ tools to be added, so each must be fully independent, load fast, and not interfere with others. Minimal code is preferred â€” avoid bloated libraries or excessive comments. Shared utilities and styles can be reused if they do not create global side effects. Prioritize best software engineering practices, maintainability, and mobile-first performance.",
